The **Feedback UI Design** project is a simple and interactive web interface built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Font Awesome icons. It provides users with the ability to submit their feedback about customer support performance. Users can select their satisfaction level and submit their feedback, which will then be used to enhance the customer support experience.
